# First-try-of-gamedev
A repository for my first attempts of creafting games.

Basicly I just did a brackeys tutorial about creating easy game in unity.
Really easy mechanics, absolutly every thing is the same like in the course.
This course was really hellpfulll becouse I've learned how to use Unity, Github desktop and Visual Studio Code with Unity extensions.
